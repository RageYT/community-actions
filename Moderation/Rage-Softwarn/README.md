# Softwarn w/out Infractions
A simple concept really, based off a suggestion by zeitlerj#3823, it allows a moderator to warn a member without giving an infraction on the user.

## Usage and Things To Note
Rather simple and quite self explanatory.

Ex. **a!softwarn @Rage for being a cock**

Included a DM feature, so the message is sent directly to the user rather than in the same channel the command was executed in.
