# Softwarn w/out Infractions
A simple concept really, based off a suggestion by zeitlerj#3823, it allows a moderator to warn a member without giving an infraction on the user.

## Usage and Things To Note
The args are separated in two different arguments using Emrison's argsplitter Snippet. First argument is the user you want to softwarn and then a reason for the softwarn separated by a **|**.

Ex. **a!softwarn @Rage|For being a cock**
