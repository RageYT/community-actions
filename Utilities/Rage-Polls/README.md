# Yes/No Poll Creation
Allows moderators to send out a poll with yes and no choices for a question.

## Usage and Things To Note
It's pretty straight forward and self-explanatory.

Ex. **a!announce embed-title|embed-description**

### Things Needing Change
In the script, you need to specify your own roles and channel for where you want to send the poll to.

You also need to change the **role-id-here** with the yes and no reacts you want to use for the poll.

#### Revised on 6/9/2020
First initial release, works as intended if configured properly.
