# Channel Announcements w/Role Mentions
Allows a moderator with set permissions to send an announcement with role mentions to a specified channel.

## Usage and Things To Note
This command requires four arguments to specify the channel to send to, which role to mention, the title of the announcement, and the description of it.

It is used by separating each argument with "|" and no spaces between each argument.

Ex. **a!announce #channel-here|@role-to-mention|embed title|embed description**
